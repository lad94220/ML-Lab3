   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter missing dependencies, ensure `requirements.txt` is present and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that you're using the correct Python version with `python --version`
- Make sure the virtual environment is activated before running the app

## Additional Notes
- Update the specific run command based on your application's entry point
- Configure any necessary environment variables before running
